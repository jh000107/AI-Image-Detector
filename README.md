# AI-Image-Detector

## Project Proposal

[This](https://github.com/jh000107/AI-Image-Detector/blob/master/documents/Enhancing_AI_Generated_Image_Detection__A_Comparative_Study_of_CNNs__Transformers__and_Contrastive_Learning.pdf) is our initial project proposal. Updates to be added.

## Data Source

The [AI vs. Human-Generated Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset?select=test_data_v2) dataset is published on Kaggle.

"The dataset consists of authentic images sampled from the Shutterstock platform across various categories, including a balanced selection where one-third of the images feature humans. These authentic images are paired with their equivalents generated using state-of-the-art generative models. This structured pairing enables a direct comparison between real and AI-generated content, providing a robust foundation for developing and evaluating image authenticity detection systems."
